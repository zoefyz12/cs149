###Solutions:

**FCFS**:

First Come First Serve simply iterates through the list of positions taking the distance between the previous and next
and adding it to the total distance traveled

Total distance traveled:

    |(2255-2055)| +   | (2055-1175) | + | (1175-2034) | + | (2034-2700) | + | (2700-513) | + | (513-1680) | + 
    | (1680-256) | +  | (256-1401) | + | (1401-4922) | + | (4922-3692) | 
    = 13279

Order of cylinders visited:

    2255,2055,1175,2304,2700,513,1680,256,1401,4922,3692

**SSTF**

Shortest Seek Time First takes the minimum element in the queue from the current head position and moves the head there.
While this greedy algorithm may produce good results, it is not guaranteed to produce a near optimal solution.

Total distance traveled:

       | ( 2255 - 2304 )| + | ( 2304 -2055 )| + | ( 2055 - 1680 )| +| ( 1680 - 1401 )|
    +  | ( 1401 - 1175 )| + | ( 1175 - 513 )| + | ( 513 - 256 )| + | ( 256 - 2700 )| 
    +  | ( 2700 - 3692 )| + | ( 3692 - 4922 )|
    = 6763
  
Order of cylinders visited:

    2255,2304,2055,1680,1401,1175,513,256,2700,3692,4922

**Look**:

Look will go up, reading everything until the max, then read everything else on the way back 
    
Total distance traveled:

    (4922 - 2255) + (4922 - 256) 
    = 7333

Order of cylinders visited:

    2255,2304,2700,3692,4922,2055,1680,1401,1175,513,256

**C-Look**: 

CLook will go up, reading everything until the max, then go all the way to minimum, then read until it gets the rest 

Total distance traveled:

    (4922 - 2255) + (4922 - 256) + (2055 - 256) 
    = 9132 

Order of cylinders visited:

    2255,2304,2700,3692,4922,256,513,1175,1401,1680,2055


**Scan**:

Scan will go up, reading everything until 4999, then read everything else on the way back 
    
Total distance traveled:

    (4999 - 2255) + (4999 - 256) 
    = 7487 

Order of cylinders visited:

    2255,2304,2700,3692,4922,2055,1680,1401,1175,513,256


**C-Scan**:

C-Scan will go up, reading everything until the max, then go all the way to 0, then read until it gets the rest 

Total distance traveled:

    (4999 - 2255) + (4999 - 0) + (2055 - 0) 
    = 9798

Order of cylinders visited:

    2255,2304,2700,3692,4922,256,513,1175,1401,1680,2055

###Code:

We wrote the following python code to quickly verify our computations:
